# Differential Gaussian Rasterization

**NOTE**: this is a modified version to support depth & alpha rendering (both forward and backward) from the [original repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization). 

```python
rendered_image, radii, rendered_depth, rendered_alpha = rasterizer(
    means3D=means3D,
    means2D=means2D,
    shs=shs,
    colors_precomp=colors_precomp,
    opacities=opacity,
    scales=scales,
    rotations=rotations,
    cov3D_precomp=cov3D_precomp,
)
```


Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields". If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us.
